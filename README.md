# RISC-OS-Raspberry-pi-Milling-Machine
The program uses the file from a !Draw file (a pre-built in software on RISC OS) and converts it into commands that are used to operate the stepper motors of the milling machine via the GPIOs. I have connected the stepper motors to screw threads which move the base of the milling machine to the correct position in a precise way. A pdf gives an example of how the !Draw file can be understood in hex.
