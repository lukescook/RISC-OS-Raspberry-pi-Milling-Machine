# RISC-OS-Raspberry-pi-Milling-Machine
The program uses the file from a !Draw file (a pre-built in software on RISC OS) and converts it into commands that are used to operate the stepper motors of the milling machine via the GPIOs. I have connected the stepper motors to screw threads which move the base of the milling machine to the correct position in a precise way. A pdf gives an example of how the !Draw file can be understood in hex.

The readable files are the same as the true files although the true files can't be viewed on GitHub or windows. The final step is to transfer the data from reader to the plotter as one program. I have also got plotter IIC for the use of an ICC GPIO expansion board.

line and test in true files are example of draw files.
