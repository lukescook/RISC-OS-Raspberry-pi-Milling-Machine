# RISC-OS-Raspberry-pi-Milling-Machine
The program can use the file from a !Draw file (a pre-built in software on RISC OS) and convert it into commands. These commands are transferred to stepper motors via the GPIOs. I have connected the stepper motors to screw threads which move the base to the ideal place in a precise way. A pdf gives an example of how the !Draw file can be understood.
